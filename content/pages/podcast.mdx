Welcome to the home of "The Flow", our podcast where we focus on what developers need to know to build the next generation of software using AI, agents and MCP.

You're welcome to listen 🎧 to these episodes, but we are recording everything in video 📺 and as a podcast for developers, we will be showing off lots of code and demos.
