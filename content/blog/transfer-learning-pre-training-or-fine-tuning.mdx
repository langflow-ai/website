Back in the early days of machine learning, when model training was a weekend project on a few GPUs, the concepts of **pre-training**, **fine-tuning**, and **transfer learning** felt simple and straightforward. You’d grab a pre-trained model, slap a classifier head on top, fine-tune it for your task, and call it a day.

If you’ve been around since the days when you could fine-tune a model like GPT-2 or BERT on a consumer GPU, today’s terminology might feel… confusing. Concepts that were once well-defined now describe workflows that are vastly different, due to the needs of large language model providers.

Machine learning hasn’t just evolved in scale; the way we communicate about it has adapted to these new workflows. Understanding how these concepts have evolved — and keeping communication clear — may be the key to bring a level of sanity to some technical discussions!

### TL;DR

#### Neural Network Era (pre ChatGPT)

*   **Pre-Training**: Training a large model on general data (foundation).
*   **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the pre-trained model for a specific task.
*   **Transfer Learning**: Using knowledge from one task/model for another.

#### GenAI Era (2024/25)

*   **Pre-Training**: Done by providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) — model learns broadly.
*   **Fine-Tuning**: You tailor a model for your app (e.g., OpenAI’s fine-tuning API).
*   **Transfer Learning**: Happens by default in APIs — LLMs adapt their pre-trained knowledge for your queries/tasks.

### Pre-Training: From Small-Scale to Industrial

In the earlier days, pre-training meant teaching a model foundational knowledge. For images, it might involve detecting edges and textures; for text, learning grammar and syntax. This process was ambitious but achievable with enough patience and a few GPUs. A lab — or even a well-resourced individual — could manage it.

**Today, in the GenAI Era**, pre-training typically involves **trillions of tokens**, enormous datasets, and infrastructure spanning thousands of GPUs. Models like GPT-4 and Claude aren’t just pre-trained; they’re **foundation models**, capable of general-purpose reasoning across countless domains.

*   **Example**: Training GPT-4 involved massive datasets sourced from diverse online content, enabling it to generalize across tasks like answering questions, summarizing, and coding.

This shift means pre-training has moved out of reach for most. It’s no longer a step in your workflow — it’s the **foundation of the modern GenAI ecosystem**, handled by a handful of organizations with the resources to scale.

Most chat models today go through a post-training step right after that which includes reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). That process turns a Language Model — a purely _next-token_ predictor — into a human friendly model with chat-like responses.

That's called instruct-tune, which is part of fine-tuning. But in most LLM contexts, talking about fine tuning means domain-specific tuning, which we'll cover below.

### Fine-Tuning: A Subtle Evolution

In the **Neural Network Era**, fine-tuning was straightforward. You’d take a pre-trained model, attach a new layer (head) for your specific task, and train it on your dataset. The base model remained largely untouched while the task-specific head learned to classify, predict, or generate outputs.

**In the GenAI Era**, fine-tuning now means **adjusting the model’s weights directly**, often across all layers, without adding anything new. It’s about teaching the model to specialize for your use case — aligning its behavior to your goals — while preserving its general-purpose capabilities.

*   **Example**: OpenAI’s fine-tuning API allows companies to tailor GPT-4 for tasks like generating technical documentation in a specific style or answering niche domain questions.

Fine-tuning has shifted from **structural changes to subtle behavioral optimization**, enabling businesses to adapt powerful models to their specific needs.

### Transfer Learning: The Default Mode

**In the Neural Network Era**, transfer learning was the cornerstone of practical workflows. You’d freeze early layers of a model — where general features were stored — and fine-tune the task-specific parts. It was an efficient way to reuse knowledge without starting from scratch.

**In the GenAI Era**, transfer learning is **baked into the system**. These models are inherently general-purpose, and adapting them to a new task often requires nothing more than a well-crafted prompt. Fine-tuning may not even be necessary.

*   **Example**: Instead of fine-tuning GPT-4 to draft legal contracts, you can guide it with a few example prompts, leveraging its pre-trained knowledge dynamically.

Transfer learning now feels invisible, happening seamlessly through interaction rather than explicit retraining.

The transition from **Neural Networks** to **GenAI times** has fundamentally changed the scale, workflows, and communication around these core concepts. **Pre-training** is now an industrial-scale operation, **fine-tuning** focuses on subtle adjustments rather than structural changes, and **transfer learning** is seamlessly integrated into modern GenAI workflows.

For those who started in the small-scale era, these shifts might seem like a radical departure. But the principles remain consistent. Understanding how these concepts have adapted in the **GenAI paradigm** helps bridge the gap between traditional workflows and the expansive potential of modern AI.
