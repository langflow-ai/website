excerpt: "Langflow just hit 100k stars on GitHub!

Langflow began as a small experiment and has grown into something far bigger than we ever imagined — thanks to the thousands who’ve written code, fixed bugs, shared feedback, and trusted it for their projects.

Hitting 100k stars is a proud milestone, but our mission to democratize AI goes on — and we still treat every day like it’s day one.

Thank you for being part of this journey."
