Langflow offers an intuitive, low-code approach to building PDF chatbots that can understand and answer questions about your documents. This powerful, open-source tool is accessible to both beginners and experienced developers. Here’s a quick look at how easy it is to build an app that enables you to chat with PDFs. 

## Setting up your PDF chatbot

[Download Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/desktop) and create a new project. Then, navigate to “All Templates”, and select the Document Q&A template to begin. The platform provides a visual workflow creator where you can assemble your chatbot's components without writing code.

![Once you select the Document Q&A template, you will see a flow with a number of connected components.](/content/images/posts/bcad34bb4852adf3e452d5bb49a86e955b4b222f-950x561.gif)

The **Document Q&A** flow contains the following components:

*   **File -** Handles PDF document upload and processing
*   **Parse Data** - Turns the PDF content into text for the next step
*   **Prompt -** The prompt we send to the language model
*   **Chat Input -** The question for the user
*   **OpenAI (or any other LLM provider) -** The Language Model that generates the answers, and finally
*   **Chat Output -** A component to render the answer

Once you add your appropriate API keys to the flow, you can immediately start chatting with your PDF by clicking the Playground button.

## Key features

While this flow works quite well for most PDFs, you could go even further using the [Docling Langflow component](https://docs.langflow.org/integrations-docling) and work with key elements within your PDF including titles, paragraphs, and tables. You can customize text extraction settings for complex documents containing images and varied formatting. 

### Interaction capabilities

Your chatbot can:

*   Answer specific questions about PDF content
*   Maintain context through Langflow’s powerful [conversation memory support](https://docs.langflow.org/guides-chat-memory)
*   Be exposed over an API for any application user interface
*   Function as an AI agent using context from your document

## Next steps

Once you’re happy with your flow, you can continue to chat with your PDF in the Langflow playground, or integrate it into an frontend user interface: this exact flow will run deterministically via an HTTP API. To use this feature, click the Share button, right next to the playground button, then the API button.

## Taking it further

Now that we’re familiar with a basic PDF chat setup with Langflow, we can take things further by [storing the contents of PDFs and other documents in a vector database, and retrieving only the portions of content that semantically match a user’s query using vector search](https://docs.langflow.org/chat-with-rag).

Happy coding!
