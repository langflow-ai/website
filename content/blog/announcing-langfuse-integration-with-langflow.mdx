We are thrilled to introduce an integration with Langfuse, an open-source observability & analytics solution for LLM-based applications.

Langfuse provides detailed insights into LLM pipelines, including reports on costs and usage. It’s model-agnostic and brings awesome traceability features such as nested tracing to pinpoint root cause issues and segment data paths.

Langflow and Langfuse together offer tools for creating and managing LLM applications, simplifying the process of optimizing and monitoring components!
