When we started Langflow, our idea was that AI development needed to offer developers more accessibility, interactivity, and control.

After months of development and feedback, today we have released Langflow 1.0, a powerful visual framework for building AI applications and multi-model agents — open-source, Python-powered and agnostic.

It’s been a great journey, fueled by your ideas and support. Let’s dive in!

### 1.0 Release

[Langflow 1.0](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow?tab=readme-ov-file) brings more flexible, modular components and the complex flows required for more advanced RAG techniques and multi-agent architectures. Langflow is now much more than a showroom of pre-built AI components; it’s the manufacturing plant!

This release delivers the fundamental building blocks required to create, customize, and share your own reusable AI components. It brings **control** over advanced AI pipelines with a variety of models, data sources, and APIs.

Along those lines, there are more affordances to manage model conversation sessions, and to start, stop, and introspect every step of flow execution. Read all about it in our [documentation](https://docs.langflow.org/)!

### Langflow in the Cloud

For many months we’ve been asked when Langflow will be available in the cloud, and now that day is here!

Today we are launching a new hosted Langflow service provided by DataStax. If you want to skip the installation and start building in seconds, this is the way to go!

[DataStax Langflow](https://astra.datastax.com/signup?type=langflow) is free to use and remains agnostic to any database, data source, or API.

Sign up for a free account [here](https://astra.datastax.com/signup?type=langflow) and try out the [Quickstart](https://docs.datastax.com/en/langflow/quickstart.html)!

### LangSmith Integration

Just 1️⃣ more thing!

Langflow 1.0 is now integrated with [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), a full-lifecycle DevOps service from LangChain that provides monitoring and observability. Just add your LangChain API key as an environment variable and you are good to go!
