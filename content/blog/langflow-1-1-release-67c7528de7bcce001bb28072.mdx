We’re excited to share Langflow 1.1! This release packs in updates that make genAI development more flexible, interactive, and enjoyable. Whether you’re building language model pipelines, developing RAG systems, or diving into multi-agent orchestration, Langflow 1.1 offers powerful enhancements to take your projects to the next level. Let’s dive into what’s new!

### A Fresh Look: Redesigned User Interface

Langflow 1.1 introduces an entirely new visual experience. With a redesigned UI featuring a refreshed logo, updated colors, and sleek branding, Langflow now has a look that’s both modern and intuitive. From the sidebar to the canvas, everything has been reimagined to make navigating and building your workflows smoother and more efficient. Learn all about our rebranding and redesign here: [Langflow Reimagined: Streamlined for Even More Productivity](https://www.datastax.com/blog/langflow-brand-and-ui-reimagined-with-1-1-release).

### Multi-Agent Magic: Advanced Orchestration

One of the standout additions in Langflow 1.1 is the new agent component, designed to support complex orchestration with built-in model selection, chat memory, and traceable intermediate steps for reasoning and tool-calling actions.

#### **Everything is a Tool**

Welcome to Tool Mode, where any component can be repurposed as a toolset for agents. Whether it’s a built-in calculator or a custom component, you can decide which fields agents can auto-fill by setting tool\_mode=True at the field level. This granular control means you can assign specific actions to agents while retaining manual input where needed.

#### **Agents that call agents, that call more agents!**

With tool mode, agents can now call other agents as tools, creating a multi-agent system where they can interact and build upon each other. This recursive orchestration enables multi-layered, dynamic problem-solving, where agents can compose complex workflows by calling one another in sequence or nested formations.

### A Smarter Playground

In genAI development, interactivity is everything! Language Models are complex, and achieving precise control often requires iterative tweaking. Langflow’s Playground is built for this — create, interact, adjust, and refine to reach desired outcomes.

The updated Playground feels more alive and responsive, offering new ways to visualize the system’s behavior in real time:

*   **Collapsible Elements**: View intermediate steps and agent actions through collapsible elements, providing a step-by-step view of agent reasoning and tool usage as they’re called.
*   **Conversation Sessions**: Instantiate multiple sessions and maintain a conversation context within each of them.
*   **Editable Messages:** Edit past messages, and (attention!) the agent will “remember” artificially **modified** inputs, perfect for quick behavior adjustments!

### Templates Galore

New to Langflow or looking for inspiration? We’ve got you covered.

Langflow 1.1 brings a library of pre-built templates categorized by use case and methodology. Jump-start your project by choosing from templates for assistants, Q&A, coding, or content generation. Get hands-on with examples in Prompting, RAG, or a basic Agent setup to dive right in. And stay tuned — we’ll be rolling out many more templates in the coming months!
