Hey there, developers! 👋 Melissa here, and today I'm diving into the world of webhooks in [Langflow](https://langflow.org/). Whether you're a seasoned coder or just getting started, this guide will walk you through setting up and using webhooks in your Langflow projects. Let's get started! 🚀

## Setting Up the Webhook Component

![Langflow Local Instance and Warp Terminal](/content/images/posts/ba30042f38228b62acee76cbd2994a756bfc7e99-1600x843.png)

For initial setup, we need Langflow ([OSS](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow) or [Desktop](https://www.langflow.org/desktop)) and a terminal. First things first, let's bring in the **Webhook** component to your Langflow workflow. 

![Langflow Webhook component](/content/images/posts/097cbc2622da924f9e0a3c9a4971a43cb086e5c5-345x219.png)

This component exposes an endpoint to your LangFlow instance. Think of it as a doorway to your workflow.

Go into the “Controls” of the **Webhook** component and obtain the cURL command. 

![Obtaining the cURL command from the Webhook component "Controls" section](/content/images/posts/0e02be7a94b40fc59f53bcfb022ba4887840b090-1208x720.gif)

To test this setup, we'll send a POST request pointing to the Langflow webhook endpoint and flow ID. Copy and paste the cURL command in your terminal.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7860/api/v1/webhook/bc1e06f6-c7de-4151-be69-955e6710fde1" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
  -d '{"any": "data"}'
```

Once you see the success message in your terminal, you know your data has made it through to the Langflow workflow. 

`{"message":"Task started in the background","status":"in progress"}`

We can confirm that the data was sent successfully by going into our **Webhook** component, and inspecting the output. 

![Inspecting the output of the Webhook component](/content/images/posts/c3ae4b8f5bd4e045f41b32b63ae5116905d15848-1208x720.gif)

## Simple Example

Now, let's add more data to our POST request: a `name`, `email`, `subject`, and `body`. 

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://127.0.0.1:7860/api/v1/webhook/bc1e06f6-c7de-4151-be69-955e6710fde1" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
  -d '{"name": "alex", "email": "alex@email.com", "subject": "This is a test", "body": "Hi Developers!"}'
```

Send this command in your terminal and make sure you see the success message. Inspect your **Webhook** component in Langflow, and notice the data comes through in JSON format.

Great! Now how do we use this data in our workflow? Enter the **Parser** component! 

![Parser component in Langflow](/content/images/posts/2f7eb8a3c18dea89f246962fc2e7c2021e1cd452-471x569.png)

The **Parser** component helps extract specific fields from the incoming data using the “Template” field. Define a template using field names like `name`, `email`, `subject`, and `body` like this:

```None
Name: {name}
Email: {email}
Subject: {subject}
Body: {body}
```

Anything that is in a curly bracket will be recognized as a column value from a **Dataframe** object or key value from a **Data** object.

Connect the output of your **Webhook** component to the **Data or DataFrame** input of the **Parser** component. Send the cURL command again, inspect the output, and voilà—you've got your data! 🔍

## 🌐 Calling Webhooks from Your Application

Now that you have your webhook set up and tested using cURL, let's discuss how to call this from your application or external service. This is where your app can dynamically interact with Langflow by triggering specific flows.

**From your application:**

1.  **Define the Webhook URL:** Your webhook URL, provided by Langflow, acts as an endpoint that your application can call. This URL is unique to your flow and is necessary for triggering the workflow.
2.  **Integrate the Webhook Call:** Within your app, use an HTTP client to make a POST request to the webhook URL. This could be part of your backend logic or a serverless function.
3.  **Implement in your Code:**

```Python
import requests
# Example of sending data to the webhook
webhook_url = "http://127.0.0.1:7860/api/v1/webhook/bc1e06f6-c7de-4151-be69-955e6710fde1"
data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "subject": "Greetings",
    "body": "Hello, this is a test message!"
}
response = requests.post(webhook_url, json=data)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Webhook call was successful!")
else:
print("Failed to call the webhook.")
```

4.  **Monitor and Adjust:** Ensure that your application handles the response from the webhook call. You may want to log success or failure, retry failed attempts, or handle errors gracefully.

**From an external application/website:**

1.  **Identify the External Service:** Choose an external service that supports webhook integration. This could be anything from a CRM to a notification service to an application integration platform like [Composio](http://composio.dev).
2.  **Generate Your Webhook URL:** In Langflow, your flow comes with a unique webhook URL. However if you are running OSS or Desktop, you cannot access this URL externally (“localhost” is not available from the internet). For this, you would need to use a service like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Render](https://render.com/) to deploy your Langflow instance to.
3.  **Configure the Webhook in the External Service:**
    1.  **Navigate to Webhook/Trigger Settings:** Access the settings for webhooks in the external service's dashboard.
    2.  **Enter Your Webhook URL:** Paste the Langflow webhook URL into the appropriate field. This tells the service where to send the data.
4.  **Test the Webhook:** Send a test event from the external service to verify that the webhook is correctly configured. Check Langflow to see if the data has been received.
5.  **Define the Trigger Event:** Specify the event that should trigger the webhook. For example, "New Email Received" or "Order Complete. Here’s an example from Composio:

![Example configuration in Composio's "Events and Triggers" feature](/content/images/posts/67014e0c97287bf6ba0b6d531c3d67a9feb4508d-1600x682.png)

![Trigger logs from Composio once the Gmail received a new email.](/content/images/posts/b2664c5a6ecb30ee66fc32f75713302dfaa71492-294x438.png)

Inspect your **Webhook** component in Langflow once more. Your payload from external services will look more like this. A lot more information and metadata than our initial example, but actual data from the “real-world” that can be used in the rest of your Langflow workflow.
