Welcome back to our Langflow micro tutorials series! We’ll continue exploring simple Langflow examples, focusing on ideas and custom component design.

_This article provides a download link for the described flow. Use it to modify and understand the components in use._

Today, we’ll focus on the flow I built for writing micro tutorial articles (yes, that’s what I’ve been using from the beginning of the series 😅). Hope you enjoy it!

#### Main Features

**LLM Runner:** Easily construct and execute a chain with no parameters.

#### Objective

The objective of this flow is to streamline the tutorial writing process by generating a Micro Tutorial based on rough descriptions of each section.

To explain it, let's start showing what we'll call the "Main Prompt Template":

![](/content/images/posts/7c83299e401a484ed9a57bc1ea8ac2d22cb2a078-800x439.png)

This prompt asks the model to revise a given text by correcting grammar, ensuring conciseness and non-repetition, maintaining the original topics, and using neutral language, which is what I expect to be done with a draft version of a Micro Tutorial.

The flow utilizes custom components, such as _Topic_, _Features_, _Feature Description_, and _Objective_, as placeholders for plain text passing. They just receive the input text as parameters and return exactly the same text.

The _Topic_ and _Feature_ texts are directly inputted into the main Prompt Template, while _Feature Description_ and _Objective_ values undergo processing by a precursive LLM before being sent to the main Prompt Template.

The Prompt Template finally takes all these texts (both human and model-generated ones) and formats them into an article-like prompt to be once more reviewed by a GPT model through the LLM chain.

By automating the writing process, this flow cleans up my rough and quickly written blogs and converts them into a bit more refined ones. This is the result:

There's typically some polishing and extra parts to be written for that to become a proper article, which indicates that those components can definitely be improved, but hopefully, this is enough to demonstrate a creative way for Langflow to help with your writing!
