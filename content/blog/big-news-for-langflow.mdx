When we started Langflow, the vision was simple: make AI agent development fast, flexible, and accessible for everyone. Today, with **tens of thousands of daily active users** and [**49,000+ GitHub stars**](https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow), it’s incredible to see how the community has embraced and expanded this vision.

Now, I’m beyond excited to share that **IBM plans to acquire DataStax, the parent company of Langflow**! 🎉

IBM has a long history of investing in open source innovation (just look at Red Hat!) and is doubling down on AI and data with [**watsonx.data**](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data). This means **more resources, more innovation, and more ways for developers to build powerful AI agents — faster and at scale.**

With IBM’s **watsonx.data** and **AI search capabilities**, Langflow will become even more powerful, helping enterprises fine-tune AI models with real-time, trusted data. Open source has always been at the heart of what we do, and now with IBM’s commitment to open AI, **Langflow will continue to thrive and grow — stronger than ever.**
