**Five Days. Big Ideas. New SuperPowers for Your AI Agents.**

📅 March 31 – April 4, 2025

Langflow is evolving—and we’ve got something special for you. Starting March 31, we’re rolling out **Langflow Launch Week**: five days of updates, surprises, and new capabilities that give developers more power and flexibility than ever before.

Every day of Launch Week will highlight a new theme. Some might feel familiar (hint: highly requested), others may surprise you. All are designed to help you build smarter, more capable, and more interactive agents.

Stay tuned for updates throughout Launch Week and sign up for our [Langflow Launch Week Livestream](https://dtsx.io/langflow_launch) on April 3rd at 9am Pacific time, where we will discuss and demo all of the announcements so far and reveal some new ones!

# **👀 What to Expect**

We’re keeping a few cards close to the chest—but here’s what we can share:

## **🧠 MCP Support**

We’re especially excited about one of the week’s biggest drops: support for **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**—both as a client and a server.

MCP is a powerful new standard for agentic communication. With MCP in Langflow, your agents can call tools from other servers—or share their own flows and tools with outside systems. Think: **agent-to-agent collaboration**, decentralized tools, and fully modular AI systems that _talk to each other_.

You’ll get new Langflow components to make it all click, plus examples and demos to help you get started. If you’ve been waiting for multi-agent orchestration to go mainstream in Langflow… this is it.

## **🛠 More Surprises, One Per Day**

While we won’t spoil everything up front, each day will bring something new:

🔊 New ways to give your agents a voice

📂 Major upgrades to how you handle files and tabular data

🖥️ A special treat for fans of local-first development  👀

🤝 And a new partnership to bring you exciting new tools and integrations!

Each announcement will land right here on the Langflow blog, with accompanying videos, demos, or livestreams to bring it all to life. You’ll find teasers, drops, and discussion happening over on [X](https://x.com/langflow_ai) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/EqksyE2EX9) too.

## **✨ Let’s Build Together**

Launch Week is about more than features—it’s about the community that’s building the future of AI workflows. We’re so grateful for your feedback, your experiments, your GitHub stars, and your wildest use cases.

Get ready. Check back Monday. We’ll see you in the flows.
