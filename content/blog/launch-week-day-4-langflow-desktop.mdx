Today, we’re excited to launch **Langflow Desktop**, a new version of Langflow that developers can run natively on their development machines.

Langflow is a powerful tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. It provides developers with both a visual authoring experience and a built-in API server that turns every agent into an API endpoint that can be integrated into applications built on any framework or stack. Langflow comes with batteries included and supports all major LLMs, vector databases and a growing library of AI tools.

**Langflow Desktop** brings this same powerful experience to your Mac in a convenient desktop package. No more fiddling with Python versions, setting up virtual environments, or waiting for pip to download massive dependencies. With Langflow Desktop, you just download a Mac app and start building. This means **less friction** and a faster on-ramp for anyone new to Langflow, as well as a more convenient tool for seasoned Langflow users who want to prototype and test locally.

We have launched Langflow Desktop on Product Hunt, so please [head on over there](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/langflow-3) to check out the screen shots and the link to download. While you're there, please let us know what you think!
