Something BIG is coming November 13.
<br><br>

Join the teams behind [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/), [Docling](https://www.docling.ai/), and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/) for the [OpenRAG Summit](https://luma.com/open-rag-summit): a virtual, code-first event where we'll unveil what's next for building open, production-grade RAG systems.
<br><br>

Be among the first to see what we're announcing and learn how to build the next generation of RAG applications.
<br><br>

Here's what you'll learn:
<br><br>

* **Why open source matters for AI** and why it's the path forward for production systems
* **When RAG actually solves your problem** beyond the hype, what use cases is it optimized for?
* **How to build with the tools that matter**: live code and demos using Langflow, Docling, and OpenSearch
<br>
We've got engineers from IBM's open source AI ecosystem showing you what actually works in production today.
