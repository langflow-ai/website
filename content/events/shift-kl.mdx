Get ready — the globally acclaimed developer-festival Shift Conference is coming to Asia for the first time: **November 4, 2025** at JioSpace (Petaling Jaya, KL).

This isn’t just another tech meetup. Theme: *“Copilots. Agents. LLMs.”* — the conference is squarely focused on how AI is reshaping the way we build software: from prompt-engineering and agent-workflows to AI-driven product teams and ethical dilemmas of the future. If you’re a software engineer, product owner, founder, or developer curious about how AI will alter your tooling, workflows or future job-role, this is a strong fit. Expect a mix of seasoned speakers, hands-on workshops and networking opportunities. 

### The vibe

Think high-production conference meets festival energy: laid-back but deeply technical; plenty of chances to chat over food & drinks, wander expo zones and come away with actionable ideas. The venue’s industrial-chic floorplans support indoor/outdoor mingling that lets conversations spark naturally.
